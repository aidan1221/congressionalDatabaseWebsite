                As you can see, a large majority of bills introduced to the House of Representatives over the course of a congressional class do not make it past 
                the status of Introduced.

                This graphic depicts the percentage of bills with a certain status sponsored by Democrats in the Republican controlled House of Representatives during the 115th congress.
                It is immediately clear that an ever higher number of the introduced bills sponsored by Democrats never made it out of the House. However, of those that did,
                a slighter greater portion of them also cleared the Senate than those sponsored by their Republican colleagues.

                This graphic depicts the percentage of bills with a certain status sponsored by Republicans in the Democrat controlled House of Representatives during the 116th congress. 
                It can be seen here that the portion of bills remaining in 'Introduced' status is higher than in the Republican controlled 115th congress. Although it is important to make note 
                of the fact that the 116th congress has only just begun it second session.

                This graphic depicts the percentage of bills with a certain status sponsored by Republicans in the Democrat controlled House of Representatives during the 116th congress. 
                Democratic bills are passing the House at a slightly higher rate than Republican sponsored bills, but as can be seen in the prior image, of the bills passing the House 
                neither Repulican nor Democratic bills are getting through the Senate at a very high rate. Only 1% of bills introduced in the House have been signed into law by the President.
